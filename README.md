# seizure-type-classification-tuh

This repo contains siamese network model for seizure type classification for two classes (background, seizure).
Dataset - <https://isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml>

The fft is generated for raw data to input it in the model. 
For more details, please refer to: `data_preparation`
